This repository was used before the 2014 FRC Kickoff, and is no longer being changed. However, we will keep this code available, as it is open source and free for any FRC team to use per the [license](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014/blob/master/LICENSE). It also has our public [documentation](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014/wiki), where we have how-to's and resources.

We've since moved all of the code for the 2014 season to the https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Robot repository, which is currently private. This repository will be made public at the end of the 2014 FRC season.
