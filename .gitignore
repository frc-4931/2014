# We are including the 'sunspotfrcsdk' files in our repo. 
# If they were managed in a better way (e.g., Maven) then we wouldn't 
# have to store them locally. But this is the easiest way to ensure 
# the SDK is easily accessible and that everyone is using the same SDK.
#
# Always include everything in the SDK ...
!/sunspotfrcsdk

# Except the JavaDoc ...
sunspotfrcsdk/doc

# Definitely include these ...
