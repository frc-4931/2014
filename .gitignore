# Git will ignore all files matching these patterns.
# If no path is given, the pattern will be applied to all files.

# Ignore the files compiled/built from Java source ...
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear

# Ignore all Eclipse-specific files except for the .project file
.classpath
.settings

# Ignore all FRC-specific files generated by the build ...
/j2meclasses
/suite
/bin
/image.suite
/image.sym
/build

# Definitely include these ...
!/resources
!build.xml
!build.properties

# We are including the 'sunspotfrcsdk' files in our repo. 
# If they were managed in a better way (e.g., Maven) then we wouldn't 
# have to store them locally. But this is the easiest way to ensure 
# the SDK is easily accessible and that everyone is using the same SDK.
#
# First, be sure to ignore some things (like JavaDoc) ...
/sunspotfrcsdk/doc

# But then always include everything else in the SDK ...
!/sunspotfrcsdk/**/*
