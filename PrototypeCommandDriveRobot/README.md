This is a very basic program to control a robot using either:

* an arcade-style single joystick, or
* a joystick for the left motoro and a joystick for the right motor

Which is used is easily changed in RobotConfig, which is where the ports for all the inputs and outputs are specified:

| Input Ports | Description |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1 | joystick for left motor or arcade-style joystick |
| 2 | joystick for right motor |

| Output Ports | Description |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1 | left motor |
| 2 | right motor |
