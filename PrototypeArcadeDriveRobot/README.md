This is a very basic program to control a robot that uses:

* an arcade-style joystick on port 1 for input, where the X-axis is the turn axis and the Y-axis is the speed axis; and
* two motors, a left motor on port 1 and a right motor on port 2.

The ports and other constants can be changed in the code.
